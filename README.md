# Core Systems Lab

This repository is my personal engineering lab for exploring **core system concepts**, **data structures**, and **performance-oriented design**.
Each sub-project focuses on implementing fundamental components from scratch - to deeply understand how things work at a low level, and to experiment with small-scale infrastructure and system-oriented projects.


Topics covered include:

* Hash tables and memory management
* System Infrastructure and performance benchmarking
* Algorithms and design patterns
* Concurrency primitives and synchronization

### Featured Project: Custom Set (HashSet)

A fully functional **hash-based set** implementation written from scratch in Python.
It includes:

* Linear probing collision resolution
* Dynamic resizing based on load factor
* Lazy deletion using a DELETED marker
* Full support for mathematical set operations and operator overloads

The project also includes a **benchmark tool** comparing its performance to Python’s built-in `set`, demonstrating identical average-case complexity (O(1)) and providing a deeper look into hash table mechanics.

For details, see:
[`custom-hash-set-implementation/README.md`](./custom-hash-set-implementation/README.md)

*(Additional projects will be added over time as I continue expanding this lab.)*
